		  Requires in future: IsMoveBlockedByAbility (251DA0)
		  Notes: Of the three, only atk06_typecalc contains the Mold Breaker functionality (besides vs Solid Rock)/Sheer Cold immunity/Gems, only TypeCalc contains the Hidden Power calc/non-Levitate ability immunities/type-resist berries, and AI_TypeCalc doesn't have anything but the immunity abilities (no Mold Breaker even); not sure what this implies

		  Implements: Infiltrator (vs Substitute), sound moves hitting through Substitute, (0203B950?)

+ 01FBA0: atk0F_resultmessage (+ConsumeItem, BattleScript_ConsumeDamageReductionBerry, BattleScript_UseGem) (see 28disasm)
		  Implements: Focus Sash (consumption on use)

		  Implements: switches around weather cases for Weather Ball animation (sun -> "ice", sand -> "fire", hail -> "rock")
		  Relies on: probably means that the weather constant is changed from (none, sun, rain, sand, hail) to (none, hail, rain, sun, sand) (why???)

		  Relies on: BattleScript_ParameterizedEffectAltTypeCalcHit relies on AlternateTypeCalc (1833D0)
		  Note: code is horrifying, get someone to fix this
		  Glitch?: Poison Leaf is missing its poison chance (might just be transcription error)
		  Note: check Magnet Force in Vega; if it lowers the user's stats, fix the Vega description; if it lowers the target's stats, it's bugged in PD
		  Note: Freeze-Dry has a 10% effect chance but no effect

		  Implements: Confide, Play Nice, Strength Sap; also refactors into the parameterized script

+ 1D6F99 -> 1053760 (repoint): BattleScript_EffectSetDamageOrMove29F (see movescripts.txt)
		  Implements: [move29F] is Ground-type, but bypasses Levitate and is neutral to Flying; condenses Sonic Boom into Dragon Rage's effect slot to free up space
		  Relies on: ConsumeItem (e01FCCC, j01F4DC), BattleScript_UseGem (e1FD42, j1F552), HasItemWithTypeEffect, AteAbilityConversionTable (j168CB4)
		  Relies on: AlternateTypeCalc (1833D0)
		  Glitch: AteAbilityConversionTable ptr is wrong, currently points to j168CA4; fixed when importing (not like it matters)
		  Glitch?: the Levitate bypassing is done by temporarily swapping abilities, which means if used on a target with Levitate, [move29F] doesn't receive the effects of the user's Adaptability, Normalize, Tinted Lens, or Klutz (as in, Expert Belt actually works despite Klutz); the target receives the effects of the user's Solid Rock, Filter, and Wonder Guard; and if both mons have Levitate, the target is still immune to the move

+ 1D8189 -> 1050480 (repoint): BattleScript_EffectMagicCoat (see movescripts.txt)

		  Relies on: script at j17D18/e18508

			btw temp 2064C0: 01 21 08 40 -> 01 20 00 00
		  Implements: New level of smart AI (enough stuff to warrant breaking the usual format)
		  * Won't use Explosion
		  * Won't use status moves on Substitute (unless Infiltrator or sound move)
		  * At full HP with Focus Sash, won't use status moves if it could be brought down to its sash

		  * If it can KO and isn't choiced, tries to use moves with 100% accuracy
		  * If it can KO and isn't choiced, tries to use moves with perfect accuracy
		  * If it can KO and isn't choiced and the target is faster, tries to use priority
		  * If its party has an average Speed of lower than 100 (or higher than 100 in Trick Room), tries to use Trick Room (and tries not to if not)
		  * If choiced and has no living teammates, won't use moves with less than 5 power (aka status and variable BP)
		  * If choiced and has no living teammates, won't use moves that anyone on the target's team is immune to
		  * Won't use Trick on a Substitute
		  * Tries to use Foul Play if the target last used a physical move
		  * (something, glitched) to Foul Play if the target last used a special move, or last used a status move but has higher Sp. Atk
		  * Tries to use Wildcard if the target last used a special move
		  * (something, glitched) to Wildcard if the target last used a physical move, or last used a status move but has higher Attack
		  * Tries to use Baton Pass if it has living teammates and it has a type advantage
		  * Won't use Sucker Punch if the target is slower
		  * Won't use Sucker Punch if it has a type advantage
		  * If target doesn't have active Focus Sash and can be OHKOed, tries to use Sucker Punch
		  * If target just used an attack, tries to use Sucker Punch
		  * If target is offensive and choiced, tries to use Sucker Punch
		  * If target is offensive, uses Sucker Punch less often if the move has low PP
		  * If target is offensive, the move has low PP, and the user can be KOed, tries to use Sucker Punch
		  * If target is defensive and just used a status move, won't use Sucker Punch
		  * Tries not to use Rest unless it has a berry or Hydration in rain
		  * Tries to use Pursuit if it has a type advantage
		  * (effect list for below: +Atk, +Spe, (+2 Atk +2 Def -1 Spe), Quiver Dance, Coil, Shell Smash, (+Atk +Spe +evasion), (+Spe +evasion), Hone Claws, Focus Punch, OHKO)

		  * Tries to use Taunt if target just used a status move
		  Relies on: new AI script commands, weather refactor
		  Requires in future: IsMoveBlockedByAbility (251DA0)
		  Glitch?: Foul Play logic has cases that loop back to the start of the AI function, this may cause infinite loops
		  Glitch?: Wildcard checks if a move isn't special to determine that it is physical - but it could be status too; fix this by moving the status move check above that
		  Glitch?: sub encouragement for berries only checks Lansat (?)
+ 1D9C74 -> 1005000 (repoint): AI_CheckBadMove
		  Implements: enough stuff to warrant breaking the usual format
		  * Bugfixes: checks for "ultra effective" as well against Wonder Guard instead of strictly exactly 2x SE
		  * Other improvements: Safeguard, Curse, Yawn, and Taunt are now checked; Sky Attack counts as a risky move; Curse isn't used when at less than half HP at the start of the turn; AI will now use Knock Off on itemless foes (due to buff)
		  * New mechanics that old scripts are updated for: electric-type paralysis immunity, dark-type Prankster immunity, grass-type powder immunity, Lightning Rod (immunity), Motor Drive, Poison Heal, Magic Guard, Leaf Guard, Storm Drain, Overcoat, Big Pecks, Sap Sipper, Aroma Veil, Sweet Veil, Bulletproof, Dazzling, Queenly Majesty
		  * Moves that bypass AI restrictions: burn moves that aren't Will-O-Wisp (this only bypasses the Fire-type check); trapping moves that aren't Mean Look / Block (aka Spirit Shackle, etc); switch-out moves that aren't Baton Pass (aka U-Turn/Volt Switch); stat-resetting moves that aren't Haze (aka Clear Smog); phazing moves that aren't Roar / Whirlwind (aka Dragon Tail/Circle Throw)
		  * New moves: Captivate, Pheromone Poison (factored into Attract script)
		  * New move effects: freeze, (confuse and lower evasion), Power Swap, Guard Swap, Reflect Type, Synchronoise, Neurotoxin, Venom Drench, Tailwind, Inflammation, Infection, Work Up, Dizzy Whirl, Zombie Touch, (lowers Sp. Atk and Sp. Def), (+2 Attack +2 Defense -1 Speed to user), Quiver Dance, Coil, Shell Smash, Stretch, Thicket Slip, Hone Claws
		  Relies on: new AI script commands, weather refactor
		  Glitch?: due to misaligned goto, only will-o-wisp is checked for prankster immunity
		  Glitch?: looks like thunder wave is checked against electric-types twice instead of electric and ground (might be a transcription error? test this)
		  Glitch?: freeze effect (1E) checks Flame Body instead of Magma Armor
		  Glitch?: Reflect Type -> Synchronoise -> Power Swap is fallthrough
		  Glitch?: [move2A3] won't be used if Venom Drench would have no effect, despite also doing damage
+ 1DA445 -> 1005C00 (repoint): AI_CheckViability
		  Implements: enough stuff to warrant breaking the usual format
		  * Bugfixes: won't use a speed-lowering move like Mud Shot if the target is immune; no longer inexplicably encourages Toxic when it has a +SpDef move; no longer inexplicably discourages Protect/encourages Snatch when the opponent has specifically Defense Curl; Protect/Snatch correctly factors in all healing moves instead of just vanilla Recover-types; sandstorm and hail are no longer the wrong way around in the Fly script; Facade correctly checks the user for status instead of the target; Brick Break is encouraged vs Light Screen, not just Reflect
		  * Other improvements: instead of a bizarre mix of moves, Mirror Move tries to prioritize any copiable move; doesn't discourage recovery when the user is faster; encourages OHKO moves after use of Mind Reader; Mean Look (because Spirit Shackle uses the same effect byte), Dragon Dance (why?), and Knock Off are no longer encouraged to be Encored; Teleport and +Sp. Def are encouraged to be Encored; instead of encouraging stealing a short list of items, Thief is encouraged for all items that don't have a downside; Chlorophyll users prioritize Sunny Day; Volt Absorb, Water Absorb, Soundproof, Thick Fat, Flame Body, and Shell Armor are considered "good" abilities; "bad" abilities (to avoid/get rid of) are also listed
		  * New mechanics that old scripts are updated for: p/s split (also includes removing the discouraging of, for example, -Atk moves or Reflect on a water-type since it can have physical STAB now), new Lightning Rod, Dry Skin, Hydration, Solar Power, Leaf Guard, Flower Gift, Harvest, Choice items, Assault Vest, Lagging Tail
		  * New moves: 0x22D, Wring Out (factored into Eruption script); Venoshock, Hex, Wake-Up Slap, Farewell Slap, 0x266, Ice Crush, 0x283 (factored into double-damage-on-status script); Brine, 0x272, 0x27A (factored into Brine script); Hone Claws (factored into Dinosword script)
		  * New move effects: (confuse and lower evasion), Gravel Breath, Power Swap, Guard Swap, Synchronoise, Neurotoxin, double-damage-on-status effects, Venom Drench, Trick Room, Work Up, Hammer Arm, Close Combat, V-Create, Hurricane, Brine, Barrier Blast, Dinosword, (lowers Sp. Atk and Sp. Def), (+2 Attack +2 Defense -1 Speed to user), Quiver Dance, Coil, Shell Smash, Stretch, Thicket Slip, Hone Claws, Payback, Psycho Shift, Acrobatics, Metal Burst
		  Relies on: new AI script commands, weather refactor
		  Glitch?: due to misaligned goto, Substitute will fall through into the Hyper Beam logic under certain circumstances
		  Glitch?: due to misaligned goto, Gravel Breath will probably crash
		  Glitch?: might cause inexplicable use of recovery moves at full HP, this might be a misreading though (test)
		  Glitch?: Destiny Knot is considered a "bad" item for Thief?
		  Glitch?: an AI script for Sandstorm is fully implemented but not actually accessed
		  Glitch?: Psycho Shift -> Acrobatics is fallthrough
		  Glitch?: Venom Drench uses Lock-On's AI script
+ 1DBA8D -> 1007300 (repoint): AI_SetupFirstTurn
		  Implements: changes which moves the AI counts as setup (removes every +2/-2, Conversion; adds sleep, Toxic, (confuse and lower evasion), Neurotoxin, Inflammation, Infection, Charge, Work Up, Dragon Dance, Dizzy Whirl, (lowers Sp. Atk and Sp. Def), (+2 Attack +2 Defense -1 Speed to user), Quiver Dance, Coil, Shell Smash, Stretch, Thicket Slip, Hone Claws)
		  GLITCH!: This actually does nothing at all due to a misplaced pointer
+ 1DBB3B -> 1007380 (repoint): AI_Unknown
		  Implements: AI layer that discourages supereffective moves for some reason
+ 1DD0C9: C5 -> CC (no idea what this does (m4a))

		  Implements: (move that calculates damage as if any Defense boosts were added to Sp. Atk, then has a 20% chance to raise Def and Sp. Atk); [moveDD]

		  Glitch?: Might crash if combined boosts are greater than +6 (or less than +0 if one of them is positive)
